Used Javascript (Django) with HTML CSS to create a meal index that tracks calories and displays what you need to lose those calories.
## Goals
The application is built to help anyone track their calorie intake similar to a search engine. 
Uses only a static page 'home.html' to present information.
Passes calorie data through djang-mathfilters identify how much work is needed to burn that amount of calorie.
